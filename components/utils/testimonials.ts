    msg: "Loved Youngsters has helped me greatly since I joined, the community has given me a sense of friends and family. Loved Youngsters under the leadership of Miss Mosimileoluwa Olunloyo has taught me to be a devoted believer, a fervent teenager who isn't ashamed of the gospel. Loved Youngsters is the place to be for any teenager struggling with their life as believers because you're surrounded with people like you who also experience the same things and who would want to also help you to attain progress and joy in the faith. Loved Youngsters has made a major impact on my life and each day, I thank God because I'm better for it. 3 years going on 4 and God's grace has really found me where I am. Thank you Loved Youngsters Community!",

    msg: "Hello, my name is Esther and I am a loved youngster. I joined LY when it was created, I'll say I was part of the first members of LY and having such an opportunity, I have seen both myself and the community grow and all I can say is thank you, Jesus! I joined LY when I was at my lowest and my spiritual life wasn't really solid but over the months, the hand of God has been mighty upon me. I have grown spiritually and it is evident and it makes me so happy. I have grown in the word and prayer. Also, I have grown morally and character-wise. I was an introvert, and still am, but I have grown to make amazing friends turned siblings. I am now able to communicate and rapport with people better. I will continue to thank God for LY and for making me a part of this great move of God. I have learnt, re-learnt and unlearned so many things. This great move of God, LY won't have been in existence if one person didn't say 'yes' to the will of God. Thank you so much Miss Simi for your labour of love. Miss Simi is ALWAYS there",

    msg: "Okay so loved youngsters has honestly help in a lot of ways that I can't begin to explain To think I was just a church goer , someone who didn't have a personal relationship with God before I joined loved youngsters, now I'm not going to say my relationship with God is exactly perfect but I had come to live with the consciousness that God is my father , and that his love is unconditional I receive the gifts of the Holy Spirit only after I joined loved youngsters, I began to understand the usefulness of prayer and the word  I got to know what it means to have friends with like minds that sharpens your teeth in Christ I felt I was worth something Loved Youngsters has changed you I am and how I see my self in Christ positively ~ Oreoluwa",

    msg: "Being dragged into The Loved Youngsters Community was the best thing that happened to me last year. As funny as it sounds, I was actually not planning on staying there for a month coz at that point in my life, the last thing I wanted was someone to be accountable to coz there was a lot going on for me that I'd rather it be hidden for a longer period but Abba wanted me at all cost. I was added to the group on WhatsApp on 19th of November 2022 by a very close friend of mine who had told me about the community since our secondary school days and I had made my intentions clear that I had no interest whatsoever in being a part. We however agreed after she added me without seeking my permission that I'd look at how things were for a month and if I still wanted to leave after then, I was free to. That seemed like a very good deal and so I sticker to it. However, it took me just a week to realise that I was home. I met the coolest adult who became my mentor and my house leader was the best at making me feel at ease. At the period of my birthday which was on the 29th of December, I was totally sure that I never wanted to leave. However, a lot of things have happened this year which made me doubt the authenticity of my membership and so many other things and I just wanted to opt out but God has always taken control and forever will. I'm not a loner but I've always hated humans generally but I met the best set of individuals in this family of God. I met people who most of them I've never met physically but they will forever hold a very special, unique and delicate place in my heart. These relationships I've been able to build with the help of God have turned out to be the basis of my spiritual growth and I can say confidently that community is really everything. I am forever grateful to God for the gift of a community like The Loved Youngsters Family. I love them and will forever do till the lights go off and turn on in eternity. ~ Ebunoluwa Chantal",

    msg: "Loved youngsters..... Wow what a wonderful family. I can't really describe how amazing this family has been and how it has impacted my life. Just through one woman who birthed loved youngsters and caters and changes lives for a reason.The first time I joined ly it was through a friend of mine. I told her that I was struggling with my devotional life because everything just felt new. Sooner or later she gave me miss Simi's contact. I chatted her up tho I didn't really know what to say, but I just gave it a try...after we started talking and then she added me to the group after the orientations and 'screening'üòÇ exercise where she asked me to explain the gospel.....  When I started joining in for prayers, my life changed a whole lot. She taught on so many things and has impacted my life in so many ways. She's not just a mentor but a mother and a friend. She's the most amazing adult I've ever come across. My growth has really sky rocketed. I mean when I look back on how I was when I first started and where I am now. I know I've grown. Through loved youngsters I was able t develop skills and birth potentials I never knew I had in me through God. And wow it's just an experience I can never forget. I've also connected with a lot of people and they've really been all so amazing. A family that looks out for another. A family of God bonded by love. Yeah I'm proud to be a loved youngster. And God bless the day I met miss Simi and the day I joined loved youngsters. Glory. May God fulfill all the things he has for ly. And ly will continue to grow in God. And may God strengthen miss Simi and bless her for all she does. For the love, care, support, effort and time dedicated towards us. We love you miss Simi ~ Favour",

    msg: "Okayyy, so let me start from here, I joined LY on the 29th of January, if I'm not mistaken. The day we had prayer stretch. A friend of mine pasted the link on his status and I clicked on it and I'm grateful I did that fr. Seeing teenagers burning on fire for the Lord, pushing you do want to do better and you know you're like, are these really teenagers?üòÇ‚ù§Ô∏è. Plus Miss Simi teachings and mentorship have blessed me. I remember when I'll come to the call with burdens and I know I'll not leave the same way I came.

    msg: "My journey since I joined Loved Youngsters has been intriguing and amazing. I can say it anywhere that the me now is far different from the me when I just joined Loved Youngsters. There has been so much growth, and God has been intentional about me through this ministry. I used to struggle with my prayer life, and I had very little understanding of some basic Christian principles like why you need to pray, the importance of praying in tongues. I can say that I had zeal for God, but there was little knowledge. But God used Loved Youngsters to bring me up and teach me. My mentor, AraOluwa, is the coolest adult ever. She takes her time to explain what I need to understand while she's teaching me. She has taught me intimacy with God, the Fatherhood of God, being vulnerable with God, not been carried away by the influence of others, purpose, gifts of the spirit, the importance of sitting still in different areas. This is the best place a teenager that is willing to grow should be, and I'm not just flattering. Loved Youngsters is an amazing community. AraOluwa is an amazing mentor. Once you get to know her, you will love her.- Enoch",
